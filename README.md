# LightWhale
> Low-Rate / Heavy Transmission Control Protocol, specialized for images (and aim for becoming multiple purposes)

The LightWhale project is a regroupment of multiples subprojects intended for IoT Wireless communication using LoRa communication system. It is separated into two differents Git:
- The Software/Hardware project, regrouping the custom communication protocol, drivers and hardware description of the home-made network card.
- The algorithms research git containing a bunch of python scripts and libs for image compression and encoding

The aim of the LightWhale project is to be able to communicate heavy kind of information (HD images) through the LoRa network using differents tricks like data compression/reduction and full usage of LoRa potential. 
To do so, a custom network card based on differents LoRa chips is currently being designed.
